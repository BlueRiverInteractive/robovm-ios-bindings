 * The AdColonyNativeAdView is used to display non-fullscreen AdColony ads in a fashion that matches the look-and-feel of your application;
 * it contains the video and enegagement components of the native ad and manages the display and playback of the video.
 * The native ad has an accompanying delegate if you need information about the video starting, finishing, or any user interactions with the ad.
 * The object also exposes additional information about the advertisement that is intended to be displayed alongside the video.
 * The native ad may include a engagement button which it displays beneath the video; the appearance of this button is customizable.
 * Instances of this class should not be initialized directly; instead, use `[AdColony getNativeAdForZone:presentingViewController:]`.
