/** The MPAdConversionTracker class provides a mechanism for reporting application download (conversion) events to MoPub. This type
 * of tracking is important for measuring the effectiveness of cross-promotional and direct-sold advertising.
 * 
 * To track application downloads, get a reference to the shared instance of this class using the {@link #getSharedInstance()}
 * method. Then, in your application delegate's didFinishLaunching method, call the {@link #reportApplicationOpen(String)} method
 * on the shared instance. With this call in place, the conversion tracker will report an event to MoPub whenever the application
 * is launched on a given device for the first time. Any subsequent launches will not be recorded as conversion events. */

	 * @param appID An iTunes application ID.
	 * 
	 *           The easiest way to find the correct ID for your application is to generate an iTunes URL using the [iTunes Link
	 *           Maker](https://itunes.apple.com/linkmaker), and then extract the number immediately following the "id" string.
	 * 
	 *           For example, the iTunes URL for the "Find My Friends" application is
	 *           https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/find-my-friends/id466122094, so its application ID is 466122094. */
