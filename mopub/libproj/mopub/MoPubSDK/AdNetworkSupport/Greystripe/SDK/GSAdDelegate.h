 * ad fetch successes and failures, ad clickthroughs, and for when a fullscreen ad will
 * take over the screen and dismiss from the screen. 
 *
 * The delegate is required to provide a UIViewController that ads should be displayed from,
 * and can optionally provide a global unique identifier for the application and a value
 * for the autoload property.

  The possible errors that may occur are:
 
   **kGSNoNetwork:** This error is dispatched when there is no available network connection.
 
   **kGSNoAd:** This error is dispatched when a blank ad is returned by the server.
 
   **kGSTimeout:** This error is dispatched when the request took too long to complete.
 
   **kGSServerError:** This error is dispatched when a server error occurs.
 
   **kGSInvalidApplicationIdentifier:** This error is dispatched when the GUID provided by the application is not a valid Greystripe GUID.
 
   **kGSAdExpired:** This error is dispatched when the ad that is fetched is expired and cannot be displayed.
 
   **kGSFetchLimitExceeded:** This error is dispatched after the SDK prevents a fetch from occurring when it is highly unlikely
  that an ad would be returned. This error can occur in high volume, low fill situations or when too
  many ad requests are made in a short period of time. This error will resolve itself after a short
  timeout. If you frequently receive this message you should reduce the frequency of your requests
  or use an alternate fallback method when no ad is available.
 
   **kGSUnknown:** This error is dispatched when the cause of the error is unknown.
 
  @param a_ad The ad that failed.
  @param a_error The GSAdError that occured during fetching.
