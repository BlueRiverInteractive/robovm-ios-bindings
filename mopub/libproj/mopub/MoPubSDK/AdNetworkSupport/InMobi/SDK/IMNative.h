 This class represents a Native ad. A minimum implementation to
 get an ad is:
 
   - Initialize an IMNative instance by providing appid
   - Load the Native ad.
   - Implement the IMNativeDelegate methods to know when to get the ad content.
 
 Below is a sample example:
 
        IMNative* nativeAd = [[IMNative alloc] initWithAppId:@"YOUR_APP_ID"];
        nativeAd.delegate = self;
        [nativeAd loadAd];
 
 * You may use InMobi class for additional targetting options.
